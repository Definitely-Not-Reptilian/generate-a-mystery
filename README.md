#### Not here to wed spiders
This Bogan (Australian) themed wedding is rudely interupted by the bride and groom announcing they can no longer get married. It is up to a haphazardous cast of hick's and drunken attendees to set the ceremony back on track before time runs out.

#### Committee To Kill
Everyone at the office of Power Industries is kept back for an after work birthday party. Suddenly, the lifts stop working and everyone gets a phone call. A hacker has planted a bomb in the office that will detonate in 2 hours! A cast of lying and self-interested office drones must work together to find a way out before its too late!

#### Spurder (Space Murder) on the Astor
You awake from cryo-sleep on a space ship destined for a new human colony 'Haven'. What should have been a leisurely landing on your new home, has been rerouted and will now fly directly into the planet at full speed! Find out who wants the mission to fail and with the help of a rag tag crew, put the Astor back on course.
