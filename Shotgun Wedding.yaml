      hotel, and were told there would be some 'friends' coming voer soon by your Drunk Uncle. They never rocked up, and as you sat talking to your Best Man you realised that you

          Bit of a scumbag. He seemed ok with you dating his daughter, but you could never get past the fact he was a dole bludger loser.

          He is kinda a controlling nightmare. He came into money a bit ago, but insists everyone keep it secret while also insisting everything that him for paying for everything.
          How can you do both? You like the stuff you give, but a tired of always keeping up appearances around him.

        strength: Strong
        words: >-
          He has been your best mate since you were tiny menaces. He was always the charmer that managed to do all the talking for you and you would go along with it.
          Great for picking up chicks at the pub. The wedding has made you nervous about missing that part of your life, so you have decided to go out on a bang. Literally. You totally banged that guy last night.

        strength: Weak
        words: >-
          The love of your life. She's pretty nice. You like her ok. You wonder if you are just falling into this marriage because it is your first serious relationship.

          Sure, she still buys all your clothes and does your laundry and makes you dinner when you want it, but that doesn't make you a mumma's boy.
          She never approved of {Bride}, but wanted you to be happy anyway.
